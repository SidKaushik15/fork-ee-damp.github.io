### EE 352 – DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING LAB



**Course offered in:**



Spring 2013


**Instructors:**



Prof V Rajababu



**Motivation:**

This course is extremely useful to provide basis for programming a DSP kit. It also helps in providing practical implementation strategies of theoretical concepts learned in DSP theory course.


**Prerequisite:**

The course is a supplement of EE338 (DSP) running in the same semester.


**Course Structure:**

The course consists of lab exercises(6-7) designed such that they cover all through the basics and then advance to solving more complex programming ways on DSP hardware.Starting with generation of sine wave on DSP to implementation of linear and circular buffer. By the end of the course implementation of floating point and fixed point arithmetic is covered and compared which is a really powerful concept. In all, the course is optimally paced and well structured to promote learning.




**Difficulty Level:**



The overall course is Moderately Difficult. Provided one does all the lab exercises seriously and in stipulated time. Exams are simple and cover things covered in theory and lab exercises.




**Grading Statistics:**

**Application of Course:**



This course is a good way to experience DSP programming. Learnings here can be extended to more advanced courses like EE750 DSP: System design and implementation. This could also be a heads up course for those interested in DSP core engineering or planning to have similar internships.
