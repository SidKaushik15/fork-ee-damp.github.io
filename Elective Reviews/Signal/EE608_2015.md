 # EE 608 – ADAPTIVE SIGNAL PROCESSING

**Year :** 2014-15 Spring

**Professor :** Prof. Kumar Appaiah

**Motivation behind the course:** As name suggests, course includes different methods for processing time varying signals and provides with basic understanding as which method can be used for a given situation. It is like a perfect specialization course for CSP students who want to enhance further understanding on filters used in practical life in earphones, speakers etc. Students find this course very interesting as it has direct application results and discusses methods which are used currently by music industry.

**Course content:**

-   FIR Wiener filters
-   FIR adaptive filter
-   Least Mean Square method
-   Recursive Least square method
-   Lattice Filters
-   IIR Wiener Filter
-   Discrete Kalman Filter
-   Causal IIR Wiener Filter
-   Machine Learning

**Course prerequisite:** As such there is no official pre- requisite but as the course is a specialization course, it requires basic understanding of correlation and auto correlation and very basic knowledge of probability.

**Feedback on lectures:** Prof. Appiah was the teacher and every student will agree unanimously that he never moved forward until everyone in the class didn’t understand. He is an excellent professor and taught everything on the board with no slides. The lectures mainly were taken from the reference book ‘Statistical Digital Signal Processing’ by Monson Hayes. The lectures were medium paced and also included examples (mainly from the reference book). Prof always appreciated all the doubts and answered very patiently. All in all lectures was worth attending and made understanding syllabus very easy and thorough.

**Feedback on assignments, tutorials and exam:** There were weekly assignments but constituted 20% of final marks. There was a midterm (30%) and an end-term (50%) and no quizzes (phew :P). Assignments were easy and needed to be programmed in Scilab. There were no tutorials as such but students can directly visit Prof. Office anytime regarding any doubts.

**Overall Course Difficulty level:** Moderate

**Grading:** Easy
