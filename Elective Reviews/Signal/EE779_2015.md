###EE 779 – ADVANCED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING

*Course offered in:**
2015 Spring

**Instructors:**
Prof. V Rajababu

**Importance of this course:**
This course is helpful for CSP-DD students.It would give you some insights on power spectrum estimation techniques which are further used in various signal processing applications,like speech processing.Speech Processing course and this course is a good combo you can try.The Direction of Arrival techniques discussed in the later part of the course also open a new field of research for you

**Course content:**
Introduction : Topics in DSP, linear algebra, matrix analysis, and statistical signal analysis (as needed)
- Spectral estimation (temporal)
    – Non-parametric spectrum estimation
    – Parametric methods for rational spectra (ARMA, MA, AR processes) and line spectra
- Selected topics in array signal processing (spatial)
    – Subspace algorithms – MUSIC, ESPRIT, Root-MUSIC
    – Applications – direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, signal separation
- Signal analysis: PCA, SVD, ICA
- Least-squares signal processing
- Linear and simple inverse problems
- Application: Source separation, deconvolution

**Prerequisites:**
- Digital signal processing – EE603 or EE338 or equivalent
- Statistical signal analysis – EE601 or EE325 or equivalent

**Grading Scheme:**
Homeworks, Quiz, Participation – 20 %
- Mid-semester exam – 25 %
- Project – 20 %
- Final exam – 35 %
Project includes: A bigger application assignment(ICA/PCA at the time I did the course)

**Grading Statistics:**

Total 25
**Feedback** 
*Lectures:* Lectures were based on slides. Most of the content are mathematical and include derivations.One needs to be continuously involved in whats going on in lectures or else it would be difficult to get things that follow.
*Assignments:* Assignments are moderately difficult, involving two parts:
*Computing Assignments:* Where in the theoretical models have to be analysed in MATLAB
*Solving Assignments:* Having problems similar to the ones that are about to come in exams.
*Exams:* Exams are challenging. Though there are some straight forward questions based on what is covered in lectures,there are also some questions which are to be thought of for a while. But doing assignments and following lectures regularly is sufficient to crack them.

**Difficulty:**
Moderate
