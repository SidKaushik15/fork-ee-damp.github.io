###EE 771 – Recent topics in Analytical Signal Processing

**Course offered in:**
Spring 2018

**Instructor:** 
Animesh Kumar

**Course content:** 
Compressed sensing, finite rate of innovation signals and their sampling methods, graph signal processing and its applications, phase retrieval problems, distributed sampling problems, machine learning for signal processing

Sir covered one paper each from each of these topics, which was then followed by a paper review based on a related paper. There was weightage for scribing the lectures as well, and each team of two people had to do the lecture scribe twice in the semester. These lecture scribes were uploaded by sir, for everyone to refer. Sir also allowed a print out of the scribes in the end-semester exam.

Apart from scribes, there were 3 paper reviews, and 4-5 homework assignments. Also, there was a course project.
The weightage was as follows:

Endsem – 45%

Scribe – 10%

Homeworks – 10%

Project – 25%

Attendance – 10%

**Pre-requisites:**
A basic DSP course would be helpful to understand the concepts taught in the course – EE338 (although not a hard pre-requisite)

**Takeaways from the course:**
Overall the course touches upon different topics, and is useful if you want to familiarize yourself with the research happening in this area.
