**Session** – 2018-19

**Instructor** – Sunita sarawgi

**Course Content** –

Basic introduction to machine learning, starting of with decision trees, bayes classifiers, naive bayes classifier and finally convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks

**Prerequisite** –
None.

**Feedback on the lectures** –
Lectures are pretty good, easy to follow and understand. Prof. taught using notes that she makes during the lectures and they are made available on moodle. In general i think notes were enough

**Feedback on Assignments/Tutorials/Exams** –

The assignments were fairly easy and straightforward. Being comfortable with python helps. Tests were medium level, not too difficult

**Difficulty** (on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being very tough) –
3

**Textbooks/References** –
Personally, I dont think textbooks were needed for the course. Also, plenty of material is available online on these topicsmiconductor DevicenFundamentals

**Softwares used** –
Scripting Languages (mostly Python)

**Comments**-

The course was not really practice based, which I would say is more important in this field.
Also, it would be recommended to do a data analysis course before this.
