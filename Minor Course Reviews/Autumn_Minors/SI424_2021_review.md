4/5 

**Course Content**

The course covers the following topics-

- Point Estimation, Method of moments, MLE, Bayesian Estimation, Properties of Estimators, UMVUE
- Hypothesis Testing, Likelihood ratio tests, UMP test, Power of Tests, Type I and II Errors, Interval Estimation

**Feedback on Lectures**

Being a Covid sem, the lectures were uploaded on Google Classroom to be viewed at any time. The videos primarily consisted of ma’am going through the notes created, and explaining with examples in some cases. The slots for lectures were reserved for doubt clearing sessions. The notes created by ma’am were extensive but a lot of effort has to be put to understand.

**Feedback on Evaluations**

The evaluation consisted of-
- 5 quizzes of 10% each
- Midsem and Endsem of 20% each
- Class project of 10%
The evaluations were fair but solving them was tough and extensive prep was required to solve the tests.

**Study Material and References**

- Ma’am’s notes were sufficient
- (https://www.probabilitycourse.com/)

**Follow-up Courses**

The rest of the minor.

**Final Takeaways**

This course is tough and you need to give sufficient time to score a good grade. It is a very theoretical course and heavy on Maths.
