**Review by**

Nivedya S Nambiar, 2023(BTech.)

**Course Offered In**

Autumn 2021

**Instructors**

Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan

**Prerequisites**

None

**Difficulty**

1/5 Very rudimentary course

**Course Content**

The course first covers basic healthcare terminology which required rote learning for some parts, especially for medical terms that were introduced. Further we had a guest lecturer cover epidemiology basics. There was a module where the ethics in healthcare was covered by a professor from the HSS department. A basic idea of database management using SQL was presented, and so was an overview of the theory of computer software used in healthcare. Coding basics were also revised in class. However, the course content and evaluation metrics may have changed since Autumn 2021, when the course was first offered.

**Feedback on Lectures**

The lectures were online, however the instructor kept a record of attendance and class participation which affected grading. The lectures were all easy to follow, as the topics covered were all basic. Different lecturers interacted with us for different modules, but most lectures were handled by Prof Ganesh Ramakrishnan. There weren't specific reference books as the topics ranged from healthcare to computer science, but the instructor puts up the references for each lecture in the slides, which covered everything that was taught in class.

**Feedback on Evaluations**

1. 10% Quiz
2. 20% Assignment
3. 20% Midsem
4. 30% Endsem
5. 20% Midsem Course Project

There was a single midsem project that included an online presentation where we had to work in groups of 2. The examinations and quiz were closed book. All written examinations were based out of the lecture slides, however they required some rote learning. The weightages and exact evaluation methods may have changed in recent offerings of the course.

**Study Material and References**

No specific books were suggested, the reference material included links to online resources and was shared by the instructor for each lecture.

**Final Takeaways**

Taking this course is mandatory for students wishing to pursue a minor in Koita Centre for Digital Health (KCDH). The instructor is flexible with the evaluations, and the course is quite chill. This course, and the DH minor, are suitable for any student, regardless of the parent department.
