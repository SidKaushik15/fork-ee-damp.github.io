### PH544 - General Relativity

**Your Name and Batch:**

Prakhar Bansal(2024, B.Tech)

**Course Offered In:** 

Spring 2022

**Instructors:** 

Prof Vikram Rentala

**Prerequisites:** 
PH 251 or PH 217(Classical Mechanics) , PH207 (Special Relativity) (Not a hard prerequisite but formal
knowledge SR is essential)

**Difficulty:** 

Moderate - Difficult

**Course Content:** 
Refer ASC (For us due to time crunch Cosmology couldn’t be covered)

**Feedback on Lectures:** 

Most of the lectures are quite heavy in terms of the content so try to pay attention in the class.Some material can be confusing and hence require thorough understanding. Class discussions are very helpful for this purpose.

**Feedback on Evaluations:** 

3 Assignments(20%) + Midsem(30%) + Endsem (50%)Assignments are very lengthy as a lot of mechanical Tensor calculations need to be done. Exams were easy to moderate

**Grading Statistics:** 

Refer ASC

**Study Material and References:** 

(i)Space-time and Geometry:An Introduction to General Relativity - Sean Carroll
(ii)Geometry, topology, and physics - Nakahara

**Follow-up Courses:** 

(i)PH 821 Gravitational Wave Astronomy and Physics (ii)PH 807 Advanced GR

**Final Takeaways:** 

A very crucial course for anyone planning to pursue a research in Cosmology/ Gravitational Waves
Physics/ Quantum Gravity
