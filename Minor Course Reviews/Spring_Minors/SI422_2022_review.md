5/5 

**Course Content**

The course covers the following topics-
- Selection of potentially relevant variables
- Data Collection
- Model Specification
- Choice of fitting method
- Model Fitting
- Model Validation and criticism

**Feedback on Lectures**

Being a Covid sem, the lectures were uploaded on the course website to be viewed at any time. The videos primarily consisted of ma’am going through the notes created, and explaining with examples in some cases. The slots for lectures were reserved for doubt clearing sessions. The notes created by ma’am were extensive but a lot of effort has to be put to understand.

**Feedback on Evaluations**

The evaluation consisted of-
- 2 quizzes of 10% each
- Midsem of 30%
- Endsem of 40%
- Group Presentation of 10%
The evaluations were fair but solving them was tough and extensive prep was required to solve the tests.

**Study Material and References**

- Ma’am’s notes were sufficient
- (https://www.probabilitycourse.com/)

**Follow-up Courses**

The rest of the minor.

**Final Takeaways**

This course is very tough and you need to give sufficient time to score a good grade. It is a very theoretical course and heavy on Maths.
