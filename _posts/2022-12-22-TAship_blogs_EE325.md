**Course offered in:**


Autumn 2022-23 <br>


**Motivation for becoming a TA:**

The ability to think about and use probability correctly as a tool is very important; I believe it is highly useful and perhaps even necessary in daily life. This course starts from the fundamentals, and I tried to make sure that the majority of students taking this course got at least something out of the experience
 
**Responsibilities”**


TAs were tasked with conducting vivas for the assignments (3 in total), grading tests (2 quizzes, midsem, and endsem) and conducting tutorials/help sessions.


**How was your experience:**


It was a fun experience overall. Making sure that students actually understood what was going on while taking vivas/conducting tutorials was difficult, but rewarding when they did. Building a rapport with the students felt nice; some even reached out about future courses/projects along similar lines.


**Time Commitment:**


Varied a lot, somewhat high around times you were supposed to grade/conduct vivas, very low otherwise.


**What advice would you give to future TAs of this course:**


Try finishing up work as soon as it shows up, especially near the end of the semester. Placements take up a lot of time and you usually don’t get a lot of time after the endsems to catch up on evaluations except for the endsem.
