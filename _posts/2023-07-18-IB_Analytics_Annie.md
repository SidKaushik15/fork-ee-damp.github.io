Hey! I’m Annie D’souza, a fourth-year undergraduate pursuing a dual degree in
Electrical Engineering and a dual minor in Computer Science and Data-Science and
Artificial intelligence. I’m into athletics and Dance and also love reading and watching
movies. I’m deeply passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning and
have been intrigued by this field ever since I was first introduced to it.

### Pre-internship:

I had a second-year internship in the field of DS & AI and thoroughly enjoyed it. Thus,
during the third-year internship season too, I targeted the same field. However, since
most of the companies didn’t open for dual-degree students, I also appeared for
software company tests as a backup and practiced coding in CPP.

Luckily, World Wide Technology, a data science company, opened up for dual-degree
students, and it began! They started off with a simple aptitude test which contained
questions to test IQ and comprehension and also your English skills. Out of all the
students that appeared for the aptitude test, they shortlisted about 30 students for
interviews.

When I found out I’d been shortlisted, I started reading about the company and its
culture (the culture here is lovely, BTW) and also prepared ML-centric theory. This
mostly included basics like different types of classification and regression methods,
neural networks, back-propagation, etc. Also, I made sure I was thorough with all the
points in my resume (this proved to be very crucial since they spent a major part of the
interviews asking me about things I’d mentioned in my resume).

The day of the interviews finally came. It was a Sunday, and three of the four interviews
taken were conducted that day. The first round was conducted by one of their India
leads, who asked me basic ML questions like how would you explain the concept of
neural networks to a 6-year-old. He also asked me about two easy puzzles and why I
wanted to work at WWT. An hour or so after the first round, they released the list of
students shortlisted for the second round, which was conducted almost immediately
after the announcement. This time there were two interviewers, and the round was morefast-paced than the previous one, mostly covering points from my resume. They asked
me if there was anything that I was particularly good at in ML. They asked me in-depth
questions about my projects and the concepts I’d mentioned, in addition to more
general ML/DL questions. I answered what I could, and for the things I didn’t know, I told
them so truthfully. They also asked me for a guesstimate and how interested I would be
in data-science consulting.

After what seemed like an exhausting in a good way half-day came the third round. If I
had three words to describe this round, they would be ‘fun, fun, fun.’ This round
consisted of four interviewers, but they made me feel very comfortable and made the
atmosphere light with some humor. It felt more like a casual chat than an interview.
They asked me to explain K-means clustering as if I was explaining it to a client
company with no experience in data science and asked me to use the blackboard if I
wanted to. They asked me a couple of other technical questions and then went on to
ask me more casual questions regarding my interest in dance and athletics and opened
up the floor for my questions. I definitely left the interview room feeling happy. After
some time, I was told that there’d be a short round the next day with one of their senior
US employees. That round was also a mix of technical and HR. I was mostly asked
about the applications of ML/DL in electrical engineering (since that’s my field), a
guestimate, and a couple of other casual questions. Soon, the results were out, and I
was slected!

### Internship Experience:

Six months later, I came to Gurgaon, and that was the beginning of an amazing two
months. The company culture and work are both very attractive. The office itself is very
beautiful and comfortable. Also, the people there were very welcoming and
accommodating. In addition to doing my own project, I was encouraged to talk to as
many employees as possible, learn about their projects, and get to know them
personally. Not only people from the Gurgaon office but also employees from outside of
India. It was really nice to see the diverse set of projects that go on in the data science
branch and also the enthusiasm with people talking about their projects and working on
them. Work never felt pressured, and we mostly had lunch together followed by several
matches of foosball (everyone at the company was sooo good at foosball, and as the
days passed, I grew to understand why they liked it so much). We also had several
company outings, including a company dinner, a football match, and a trip to Kashmir.
All of these served very well for bonding. Everyone here was always ready to help, and
the office was always in good spirits, reflecting the good culture.

### After the internship:

All in all, it’s been an excellent and amazing two months here at WWT, and I would
definitely recommend this company to anyone interested in ML/AI – They have a great
culture, great spirit, and a great work environment. For people targeting roles in ML/AI,
no matter which company you’re interviewing for, I’d say make sure your ML basics are
strong, and you are thorough with all the points on your resume. When you appear for
an interview, make sure you are frank and open; if there’s something you don’t know,
tell them you don’t know. Companies love to see students who show an interest in the
company’s work culture or the kind of work they do, so make sure you convey that in
your interview, and may the odds ever be in your favor (yes, a hunger game reference).
