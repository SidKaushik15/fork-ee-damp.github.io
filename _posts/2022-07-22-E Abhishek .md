### Basic Information

- **Project Title**: Modernizing land records
- **Name**: E Abhishek 
- **Project**: BTP
- **Semester(s)**: 2
- **Guide**: Prof Milind Sohoni,(Co-Prof Harish Pillai)

### Abstract


Most land records departments in India use British-era maps and ground control points(GCPs) to demarcate ownership boundaries. These paper or cloth maps lack geospatial information(latitude and longitude of each point), thus leading to conflicts among neighbours during survey processes. There are more than 1 lakh land dispute cases in Maharashtra alone!

To solve the land dispute problems, the Government of Maharashtra(GoM) decided to modernise their land records. They planned to capture the satellite image of a village and compare the digitised version of the village map with it. Then they would modify the map within permissible limits such that the ownership boundaries in the map follow hedgerows or farm boundaries. This manual process requires a few days of work for one village and is prone to error. The GoM would have to move many resources to accomplish this project for 40k villages in Maharastra. 

We proposed a pipeline of automation algorithms to modernise the land records using segmented satellite images and digitised village maps, thus reducing the work time for a village from a few days to a few minutes. We used Python and Bash to write scripts and tools such as QGIS and PostGIS to process spatial data. We presented our outputs to 10 villages as a part of Phase 1 engagement with GoM. 

### Any courses you completed relevant to the project


CS213
### Describe your experience on the project


Solving fundamental engineering problems was Prof Sohoni's pitch during CS213 M classes. I liked the idea, so I approached him for a project. The project involved brainstorming sessions, data cleaning, extensive coding, field visits and many meetings with external players like the government, Google research and consultants. There is a possibility of publication, but that is not the primary objective; it will be a by-product. The tasks consume a lot of time, around 10-12 hrs per week. Since I liked the project, I spent 15-20 hrs per week and worked on it during summer and winter break.
### Describe your experience with the guide


He is one of the few profs who pays students for their project work. 

He expects us to get an MoU with some agency to receive AA in the course. 

He spends a lot of time with the students, one can expect 3-4 hrs of meeting every week.
