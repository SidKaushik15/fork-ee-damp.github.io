**Basic Information:**\
 **- Name:** V L Pravallika\
 **- Curriculum:** BTech EE\
 **- Year of Study:** 4th\
 **- Company/University of Internship:** Bajaj Auto\
 **- Year of Internship (eg. \'23 Summers, \'22 Winters):** 23' Summers\
**- Mode of Internship (Online/Offline/Hybrid):** Offline\
 **- Duration of Internship:** May to July

**Getting into the Internship:**\
 **- What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?**

I targeted in Core, either Analog, Digital, or Power electronics domain. The main point was that I wanted to go into core or management-marketing and hence applied for core and focused on all these three, as I wanted to try exploring in any. In non-core companies, I applied for product management and operations management roles. Power electronics was interesting to me as I was already doing a project in that domain.

**- What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?**

The previous year questions put by seniors, online websites which have generic core company questions. Asking friends about their interview experiences, and also my previous experiences, helped.

**- Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?**

My interview was relatively short, of 15-20 minutes. It had some basic conceptual questions about my on-going project in IITB, my interests, motivation, and some basic electrical questions about diodes and mosfets.

**- Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?**

Yes, I faced some technical issues in the internship process. I could not give the written test for TI as they had some technical issue in finding my name even after my registration. Hence, I could not proceed. In ITC interview, due to timing issues overall, the panelists decided to take no further interviews. Apart from these small issues, overall it was ok. The process involved some pressure due to continuous results of peers and classmates, but if you are able to get through without worrying much about your future and PPO and very
further stuff as such, you will be just fine.

**- How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?**

The key was to not bother too much about my peers. You will get through the process with a good internship. That confidence should be there in yourself. Initially, I put a lot of effort for each written test and interview, ignoring my academics a little. I took the rejections personally. But then after 4-5 interviews, I realised that this is a good experience and started to find humour in rejections, putting me in a light-hearted mood to crack the next one.

**During the Internship:**\
 **- What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?**

My project topic is Automatic fault diagnosis and prognosis in Chetak EV. It is overall electrical, involves communication networks and Electric Vehicles.

**- How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?**

The work is limited to office hours. The timings are flexible and I can enter the office and leave it anytime I want to without much scrutiny. Their expectations are that I complete my work on time. Micromanagement is not existent. The mentors are very supportive and help me throughout my internship, helping me navigate through my problems and some alternatives I ideate.

**- Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?**

The work environment is excellent, with mentors very frank and easy to approach. The campus is like IITB campus, with a proper recreational centre for maintaining physical and mental health while working in the company. My teammates working with me are supportive to each other, helping each other for intermediate problems.

**- Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?**

I have interacted with many people in RnD department for EV development, and gained a lot of insights from them about their work.

**After the Internship:**\
 **- Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective?**

Yes, I would tell you not to look at the stipends if you are planning to go for core, as they should not be compared with software internships ;)

**For people who have completed their intern:**\
 **- What are you currently involved in or pursuing following the completion of your internship?**

**- In what ways has the internship influenced or impacted your current activities and future endeavors?**
