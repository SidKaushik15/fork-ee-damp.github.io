### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
I wanted to get an internship in electrical core, preferably in hardware

#### What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?
Revised the things that were taught in the core courses

#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
I was asked questions about the first project on my resume, which was the course project of EE-309.
The questions were mostly based on the concepts of pipelining and caches. A few basic questions on
STA (static timing analysis) were also asked. The interview was mostly technical with a few non-tech
questions like ‘what all do I know about Qualcomm’ in the end.

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
No, the process went smoothly

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
Facing rejections can get tough sometimes, but you’ll have to believe in yourself and try to learn from
your past interviews/tests. Keep trying but at the same time try to explore other options too (like
applying externally, or if you were just targeting industry intern then start looking for univ interns too)

### During the internship:

#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
I worked in the physical design team that did everything after RTL and before fabrication. I mostly
worked on the floorplanning part of physical design.

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
The experience was good and I did get to learn a lot. But my work was a little boring and I expected
something that was more challenging

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
The culture was nice and accommodating. People on my team helped a lot. There was never too much
work and I had time to play some TT almost every day :)

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
Yeah, there were such opportunities

### After the Internship:
#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective?
I would recommend this if you’re looking for a hardware internship. Yeah, the work might not be as
interesting as you’d hope but that is the case with many hardware companies. But still the work was
fine and I did get to learn a lot.
