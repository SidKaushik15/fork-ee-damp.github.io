 **Basic Information:**

 **- Name:** Neeraj Prabhu\
 **- Curriculum: Dual Degree-** Electrical Engineering B.Tech\
 **- Year of Study:** 4th\
 **- Company/University of Internship:** University of Utah\
 **- Year of Internship (eg. \'23 Summers, \'22 Winters):** '23 Summers\
 **- Mode of Internship (Online/Offline/Hybrid):** Offline\
 **- Duration of Internship:** May to July '23

**Getting into the Internship:**\
**- What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?**\
I was mainly looking for research internships related to digital design and computer
architecture. There was also some VLSI design profiles I was looking into but my main
focus was on computer architecture

**- What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?**\
For computer architecture, I mainly studied from my notes and slides from the Advanced
Computer Architecture course. For digital design, I used wakerly and mano (but that was
when I was preparing for PT cell company interns).

**- Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?**\
My first meeting with Prof Rajeev was more like a discussion rather than an interview. We
mainly discussed stuff related to my experience and what I had done before related to
computer architecture. Then we had a brief discussion on the work that is going on in his
lab and if there is anything that I should get started on reading to narrow down on a
problem statement.

**- Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome
them?**\
It was slightly difficult to get into the groove of mailing professors continuously,
especially managing this with acads. I was also pretty confused about whether I
should mass mail professors and hope for a reply or try to personalize each mail with
what I found interesting in the professor's work. Eventually I found a balance and for
some of the professors, I used to go over a paper or two and mention what I found
interesting from their work. This was mainly for those I really liked and would love to
work under. It was also slightly difficult to figure out which professors to mail. It was
taking too much effort to go over websites of universities and trying to figure out
which of the professors there had good research in computer architecture. Luckily, I
found a website csrankings.org which made the process easier for me.

**- How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?**\
I had originally applied for 3 companies in PT cell, because I was worried about
whether I would be able to get a university internship. However, I got rejected from all
three and was pretty sad when that happened. After that, I decided that I would focus all my efforts towards applying to universities and getting a research intern externally.
Initially it was difficult, because some professors just did not reply, some said that they
did not have places for interns this year, some said they only take PhDs etc. Some
professors also have issues with intern funding or not wanting to go through all the
paperwork. I did not lose hope though and kept trying.

**During the Internship:**\
**- What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?**\
The internship mainly dealt with computer architecture and a little bit of cryptography.
The main goal of the project was to accelerate fully homomorphic encryption using a
near data processing hardware system (UPMEM).

**- How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?**\
My experience was pretty great. Everyone in the lab was very helpful and guided me very
well especially when I was working on things that were very new to me. The lab was not
very big, so the professor was able to have individual discussions with everyone twice a
week and used to check in on the progress in those meetings. The work was very
interesting and with FHE being an upcoming algorithm, I got to work on very new
concepts and hardware.

**- Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?**\
Unfortunately there were no other undergraduate interns with me (the only downside I'd
say). The lab members were all PhDs and there was also one MS intern for the summer.

**- Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you
established during the internship?**\
I am not a very outgoing person, so I did not really go and meet other people in the
other labs. There were a few people who would occasionally come to my lab and we
talked a little about the work we were doing and also found some people who were
working in similar areas.

**After the Internship:**\
**- Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested
in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what
factors influenced your perspective?**\
I would definitely recommend this internship to anyone interested in software. The
reasons are already listed above but to summarize: great pay, great company, great
people.
