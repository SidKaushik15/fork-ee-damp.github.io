### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
Quant or software

#### What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?
Mostly guidance from the talks that happen during summer vacation.
For Quant : Brainsteller, Green book of quant, Brushing up on probability, basic DSA (from striver)
For software : Solving easy and medium problems form leetcode

#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
I had 3 interviews:
- First was on puzzles, almost all of which I have read on brainsteller website or in green book of
quant
- Second was on coding, they just wanted to know logic (had to write a pseudocode), questions
were related basic data structures
- Third was focused on bit of HR and probability, in probability the question was related to
correlation

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
There were no major roadblocks but if you know that you would be selected in most of the firms which
you applied to, then you need to properly prioritize them and devote time accordingly.
Basically learn to choose your battles

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
Though I was rejected by all the firms but one, I got selected on day1 so I might not be able to answer this
question better. Still I would say it's important to be patient. It is hard to stay motivated but there is no
other way so rather than focusing on the past, best to put all your efforts on the upcoming challenge. It's
easier said than done.

### During the internship:

#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
Profile was quant, I am not allowed to disclose my project yet.

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
Pretty hectic, as you would expect from a quant firm, but all the compensation and hospitality were
awesome. As someone who was mainly interested in knowing what quant is all about, it was a fulfilling
experience.

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
Interns were stationed on the opposite side of employees location, so basically we didn't have much
interaction with employees. You can say there is little to no hierarchical system.

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
All the communication we had was during weekly meets with mentors who are a year or 2 older than us,
so there was not much of networking opportunities or building connections, not more than mere
acquaintances.

### After the Internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective?
Well let me just list pros and cons and one can decide on their own:
Pros
- Good hospitality and everything else, so one need not worry about anything
- For someone who want to learn about quant and market, it is not a bad place to ge basic
understanding
- Good compensation, in fact highest pay in indian quant firms.
- Number of selections are high so you can have a better chance also can meet so many people
- People you would be working with are also form IITs so you can have same level of intellect and
communication, basically you won’t feel out of place
Cons
- At Least for internship we had to devote 10 hours or something daily
- Right from the start, they used to prompt us about PPO, which in fact is not a healthy way to
motivate a student during internship. Internship is a place to learn instead they make it a big 2
month test without teaching them anything.
- Previous point could be subjective, to those who love competition it would be an appealing point,
but for me atleast who purely went there to learn, it wasn’t so appealing. The internship
environment felt a bit toxic, more of a rat race. Again THIS POINT IS PURELY SUBJECTIVE
