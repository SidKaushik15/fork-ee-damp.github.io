### Basic Information

- **Project Title**: Voice Activity Detection using LSMs
- **Name**: Dev Pratap Singh
- **Project**: SRE
- **Semester(s)**: 7
- **Guide**: Udayan Ganguly

### Abstract


VAD has been performed using RNNs and CNNs. LSMs are power optimised and consume less resources, so had to try the implementation on them.
### Any courses you completed relevant to the project


EE746 - Neuromorphic Engineering
### Describe your experience on the project


The project was equally theoretical as well as coding related. Had to study research papers and build a model on MATLAB. I extended the project as an RnD project and worked on a modification of the spike generation. Workload was chill and weekly sync-ups were there. 
### Describe your experience with the guide


Udayan Ganguly is very interactive and encourages you to come up with original ideas on how to tackle a problems. He gave time to every student individually and weekly meetings were conducted. He was very approachable and is open to bilateral talks with students.
