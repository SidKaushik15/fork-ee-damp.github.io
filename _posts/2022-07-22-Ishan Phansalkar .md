### Describe your experience on the project


I chose Prof Maryam because she's also my CMInDS IDDDP guide. Work was pretty light, mainly literature review and some implementation. I didn't think about publications because I'm not inclined towards academia but there's a possibility since the field is still rather developing.
### Describe your experience with the guide


Once a week meeting. I recieved little guidance, it was mainly me looking at papers and providing suggestions. The prof has limited ML knowledge.
