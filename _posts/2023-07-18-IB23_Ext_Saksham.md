### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?

My main area of focus was software development, but for the past semester, I started targeting Machine Learning, and I got this role as a Machine Learning Researcher.

#### What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?

Most of my information came from two sources:

1. Online Courses: You can find great courses on YouTube and Coursera. It is better to take a reasonably priced online course(especially one with projects and assignments) as they are well-structured, and you will not waste time searching randomly.
Once you have the basics down, then specific topics can be learned separately for free online.

2. IITB Courses: Find the best IITB Courses suitable for your needs. There are courses that teach you from scratch, and there
are courses that build upon the fundamentals. Create a good study plan that fits every niche and participate actively.

#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?

My interview process was based on my project and course experience, and I also needed to present a literature review on a research paper based on their current project. They wanted people with a strong fundamental understanding of Deep Learning that could start working on projects with minimal training.

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?

Due to various reasons, a major one being getting rejected due to not being in my pre-final year, over 120 companies rejected me. But the only advice I have here is to get up, dust it off, and keep upskilling yourself. It\'ll happen someday.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?

Due to various reasons, a major one of my reasons for getting rejected was due to not being in my pre-final year. Over 120 companies rejected me. But the only advice I have here is to get up, dust it off, and keep upskilling yourself. It\'ll happen someday.

### During the internship:

#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?

Machine Learning Research, developing and implementing ML models.

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?

Great. You get out of your circle, meet new people, learn to live alone. It\'s awesome.

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?

People are amazing. The organization is structured based on departments working under the CEO, and each department having 3-4
levels of managers, then employees and interns.

The culture is great, we have game days, after work parties, and an overall chill environment, with freedom to work at your own times and place.

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?

Met lots of influential people, including VPs and senior VPs. People are generally considerate and helpful.

### After the internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective?

Internship is worth it, especially considering the growth level. Due to ML being a relatively new field of exploration in the
department I have my internship in, learning is high and fast paced, even in a corporate environment, making it a perfect place for both development and networking.

### For people who have completed their intern:

#### What are you currently involved in or pursuing following the completion of your internship?

Applied for a Master\'s under the CMInDS department through the IDDDP programme, and will most likely aim for a foreign industrial research based job, or a Phd from Ivy League Universities in the Machine Learning or Computer Science Department.

#### In what ways has the internship influenced or impacted your current activities and future endeavors?

This internship gave me a solid platform and backing that proves my skills in any and all future endeavors I take, whether research oriented or industry oriented.
