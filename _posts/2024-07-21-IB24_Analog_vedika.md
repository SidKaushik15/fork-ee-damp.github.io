### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
I targeted the Analog domain Electrical Engineering for my internship. Side-by-side, I was trying for Digital as well, but ended up in the Analog domain only

#### What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?
TI provides its own collated resources, which are very good, and should be gone through very well. Their main point is that the basics must be clear, and the resources that they provide outline this very well. Other than that, I targeted EE204 (Prof. Zele) notes available on CDEEP as well as my own notes of the same from when I took the course. EE204 is a must in my opinion for the Analog domain atleast.

#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
In the interview, they mainly focused on the very basics, such as RC circuits. Analysis of circuits was done, with there being buildup on the same circuits as we went through the interview. Op-amps were also touched upon. I also was asked about the analog projects I had on my resume.

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
The process was mostly smooth, with no major roadblock being faced.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
I had applied for, and reached the final stages of the Google internship application, but I was rejected from it. Rejection is never nice, so I let myself stew on it for a little time, and then move on, since the other companies process was also ongoing at the same time. The 2nd company which I applied for and reached the interview levels was TI only.


### During the internship:

#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
Throughout the internship, I worked with a team that worked on validating motor drivers, and my work was mainly helping automate the process. Cannot divulge more details.

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
My overall experience was very good at TI. I learnt about how the industry works, and what all are the areas of focus for companies. The work itself did not require much theoretical knowledge, but it was more focused on finding practical solutions to the problems.

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
The work culture was very positive. The company has flexible timings, and the work environment is very relaxed. I had a very supportive mentor and team, who were receptive to the ideas I had. It was an overall very good experience.

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
There were sessions held by TI from various different departments throughout the 2 months duration.

### After the Internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective?
This internship is definitely recommended for people interested in the core domain and want to go into the corporate industry. It might not be interesting for people that want more theoretical work, but it will provide insight into how the industry works. There are a lot of resources available for self-learning all that is required, and more.

### For people who have completed their internships

#### In what ways has the internship influenced or impacted your current activities and future endeavors?
The internship has provided me insights into whether I want to go into this field, and is a good opportunity for people to get clarity on the same.
