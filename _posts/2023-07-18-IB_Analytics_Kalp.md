My name is Kalp Vyas, entering my 4th year in B. Tech program in Electrical
Engineering. I interned at Adobe during the summer of ‘23. My role was a research
intern with more emphasis on software and ML aspects.

### Pre-internship:

I had targeted a software role for my internship and had applied for most of the software
roles that had come during the internship season. For the tests, I mainly practiced
questions from leetcode and codeforces.

Coming to the internship season, I had gotten interviews at Graviton, Qualcomm, DE
Shaw, Oracle, and a waitlist in Microsoft before getting selected at Adobe finally. In
Graviton and DE Shaw, I was rejected for the interview because I was unable to answer
the technical questions asked. In Oracle and Qualcomm, there was almost a fully
HR-based interview, and I was rejected after that.

Coming to Adobe, the test had two coding questions and a few CS theory, LA, and
probability questions since the company had come for three profiles - Research,
Product, and MDSR. One of the questions was simple and implementation based, and
the other one was a tougher DP-based problem that was asked to me during my DE
Shaw interview, which I wasn't able to answer, but because of that, I was able to answer
it here and did very well in the test. I had applied only for the research intern role and
had a single-round interview for it. The interview was taken by an IIT B alum itself, and it
was mainly about my resume and my experience in ML. It was a short 15 min interview,
after which I was selected for the role.

### Internship Experience:

My internship at Adobe is along the lines of Machine Learning, in particular generative
AI and LLMs (Large Language Models). It is quite an interesting project, and we were
given the project in a group of 3 interns, and 2 mentors were allotted to us. The aim of
the project is to get a patentable product or at least a paper out of it, which will be
helpful from a master's point of view as well as from the point of view of the company.
The mentors allotted to us were quite helpful, and I enjoyed working on this project. We
have daily meets with our mentors where we discuss our progress.

The work culture at Adobe is excellent, and they really value the time and effort you give
to the company. There are no fixed timings, and as long as your work is being done,
they are satisfied. Further, interns are treated the same way as employees and have
access to the entire building and its various amenities, which makes it a very
memorable experience. There were also continuous team-building sessions and fun
events conducted to make the interns feel more comfortable and interact with everyone.

### After the internship:

From a technical point of view, Adobe is one of the best companies to work for if you are
interested in machine learning and AI. The work being done there is state of the art, and
there are quite a lot of awesome people with amazing knowledge in the field, and I
would definitely encourage people to intern here.
