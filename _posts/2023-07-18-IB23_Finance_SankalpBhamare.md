**My Journey: From an Electrical Engineering Student to a Morgan Stanley Strats and Quant Intern**

**Introduction:**

Hi everyone, I am Sankalp Bhamare, a third-year UG student studying
Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay, sharing my journey to joining
Morgan Stanley as a 2023 Summer Strats and Quant Intern, a 10 weeks
program offered under the Fixed Income Division.

**Internship Preparation:**

During my internship preparation, my primary focus was on domains
related to technology, specifically Software Development and FinTech,
which is a combination of finance and technology. To enhance my skills
in these areas, I turned to resources such as LeetCode and InterviewBit.
These platforms provided a wealth of coding exercises and
interview-style questions that were relevant to major software
development companies recruitment process. By utilizing these resources,
you can significantly improve your coding abilities and problem-solving
skills, which are crucial for excelling in interviews.

Additionally, I would like to emphasize on building a strong resume. I
actively worked on various software development projects in Machine
Learning, Image Processing etc\... One notable experience was being a
part of the software team of AUV-IITB, where I gained practical
experience and learned various skills of team working, development
practice on an industrial scale codebase . These projects added value to
my resume and significantly increased my chances of being selected for
interviews.

Overall, my targeted preparation, coupled with relevant projects and
continuous skill-building, allowed me to align myself with the desired
domains and enhance my prospects for securing the internship
opportunity.

**The Interview Process:**

During the interview process at Morgan Stanley, the questions are
specifically focused on concepts in C++ and Python. Additionally, there
were logic riddles and basic math questions that drew from topics
covered in first-year courses, such as matrices, differential equations,
and probability, and in general questions evaluate the problem-solving
skills of the candidate.

**Navigating Challenges:**

No journey is without its challenges, and mine was no exception. Prior
to receiving the opportunity at Morgan Stanley, I encountered rejections
from other companies, including Optiver, Microsoft, and DE Shaw. While
these setbacks initially were saddening, I refused to let them define
me. Instead, I considered each rejection as an opportunity for a new
interview. I held onto the belief that with every interview, I finally
was able to get into Morgan Stanley.
