### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
Mainly fields related to digital systems or machine learning.

#### What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?
For electrical profiles, I referred to my class notes and apart from that some interview questions on the
internet related to STA. For machine learning, went through my projects once again and revised the basics
taught in DS203,DS303

#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
The interview was around 40 mins. Questions were related to digital systems only and one basic puzzle. If
you know verilog then it's a plus point. In digital profiles, some repeatedly asked questions are about
making some logics using mux, FSMs, FlipFlops and shifters.

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
No, I feel the internship process is smooth for all students. Giving tests every day might get hectic. It's
better to prepare beforehand in the summers before the internship season start.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
I gave interviews for Texas and Mastercard too.Itâ€™s fine to have rejections given that you know what went
wrong in those interviews and focus on rectifying those mistakes.

### During the internship:

#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
I am in the SOC (System-On-Chip) Integration Team.

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
It's good if you want to explore the electrical domain side but as an intern you are not assigned on some
main projects and do mostly automation stuff. I was lucky enough to get some work related to electrical
here where I had to make some new proposals. Apart from that, most of us have python scripting work
only. But we did got to know how building of major chips works

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
The work culture is very good and everyone is friendly around. We have a manager and a mentor assigned
to us who helps in tasks given to us. There were many events organized by the company, some exclusive
to interns and some for all. People are really supportive and ready to help if you are struggling with some
problem.

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
We had networking opportunities between interns during the orientations and at the place where we stay.
Each team has at most 2 interns so you don't get to work with fellow interns but I made some connections
with the employees within the team itself.
