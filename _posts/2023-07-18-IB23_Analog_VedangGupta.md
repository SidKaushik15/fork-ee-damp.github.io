**Basic Information:**\
**- Name:** Vedang Gupta\
**- Curriculum:** Electrical Engineering Dual Degree\
**- Year of Study:** 4th\
**- Company/University of Internship:** Texas Instruments\
**- Year of Internship (eg. '23 Summers, '22 Winters):** ‘23 Summers\
**- Mode of Internship (Online/Offline/Hybrid):** Offline\
**- Duration of Internship:** 9 weeks/2 months

**Getting into the Internship:**

**- What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?**

??

**- What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?**

I revised the material covered in our electrical core courses for the tests and interview. Most
questions could be solved using the basic knowledge of MOSFETs, OPAMPs, etc. The
questions in the tests involved a lot of calculation of the parameters of the circuit like gain, input
and output resistance, etc. I would say if you are clear with these concepts, the tests shouldn’t
be too difficult.

**- Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?**

The interview is mostly technical and they primarily want to test your problem solving skills and
conceptual understanding. My interview started off simple with just a RC circuit and built up to a
more complex circuit by adding components around them and the interviewer asked me how the
output changed at every stage. The interviewer would nudge me in the right direction with hints
if I tended towards the wrong answer. I would say as long as you are clear with your concepts
and can pick up the hints that the interviewer drops, that’s what they are looking for and the
interview should be a fun and interesting experience.

**- Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the
internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome
them?**

NA

**- How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship
application process?**

NA

**During the Internship:**

**- What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?**

My internship profile is Analog Design Engineer at Texas Instruments. I am working on
improvements to two of the components of the IC (integrated circuit) that my team (IdealDiodes) is currently working on. The improvements should be incorporated into the next stage of
their design process.

**- How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?**

The internship at TI is a very fun and fulfilling experience. I am thankful that I got the role as a
Design Engineer because that is a challenging and rewarding task. I have a learnt a lot more
about analog circuits than before in this brief amount of time. I also got exposure to industry
process, tools and software. As an Analog Design Engineer you have to consider a lot of
aspects to the problem (e.g., layout considerations, effect of mismatch, etc.) that are important
to your design which make it quite challenging but also fulfilling. My mentor was very helpful and
guided me well throughout this process giving me good guidance and pointed me to relevant
learning resources whenever needed. The internship is quite flexible and gives a lot of freedom
in how you wish to work. A lot of my friends at TI (but in different profiles) also had the option to
work from home. The thing I liked most about the internship is how they didn’t hesitate to
include me in the core design process and did not just give me menial tasks.

**- Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university
and what your peers were like?**

The teams at TI are quite organized and most of their employees in my experience are very
hard working. There are frequent meetings and the process is quite collaborative while giving
individual freedom. Due to the above they do expect a certain amount of hard work from you
and getting work done on time. A lot of people work from home a lot of the time and there are
often hybrid meetings. I observed my mentor working late some times due to deadlines but I
think that’s common in a lot of work cultures but might be worth considering for some. As an
intern I was never forced to stay late or work late but I did do that sometimes. The members of
my team and other peers are quite smart and productive. They were very nice and inclusive of
me and it was a overall positive work experience.

**- Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you
established during the internship?**

NA

**After the Internship:**

**- Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested
in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what
factors influenced your perspective?**

I would definitely recommend interning for Analog at TI. TI is primarily a analog
engineering company and one of the best in the world at that (so it’s definitely a good
resume point ;) ). This leads to you contributing to quite important products giving you
relevant industry experience and a whole lot of learning. The office culture is inclusive
and productive, the food is great (but not free), there are nice amenities like sports
courts, cultural clubs and a gym. The mentors are responsive and helpful. Some mightfind the stipend less appealing but the learning, flexibility, perks and fulfilling work
definitely makes up for it for anyone looking to work in analog.
