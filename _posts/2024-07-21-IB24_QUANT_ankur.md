### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
I was preparing for both the profiles of SDE and Quantitative Researcher

#### What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?
For SDE I did CP problems on Codeforces and Leetcode.
For Quantitative Research, I solved puzzles from Brainstellar, Ted Puzzles on YouTube, and some books
such as Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance by Xinfeng Zhou; Fifty Challenging Problems in
Probability by Frederick Mosteller and some relevant sections from the book Quant Job Interview
Questions & Answers by Mark Joshi and Nick Denson.

#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
I had two interview rounds. In the first round, I was asked about some puzzles that were similar to the
ones found on Brainstellar etc. In the second round, they asked a bit about my previous internships as they
were somewhat related to finance and then they gave me 2 probability problems that were from medium
to hard level.

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
Since I applied for the internship externally, I had to reach out to a couple of HRs on LinkedIn, some of
them replied some of them didn’t.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
None

### During the internship:

#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
I had to work on developing some new alphas that are used in trading, other than that I am not supposed
to go into too much detail about my project work.

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
It was pretty good, had an amazing learning experience and allowed me to work with some brilliant minds
out there.

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
The peers were amazingly supportive and friendly too, and I didn’t feel like I was an outsider. We went on
regular team outings which built a good bond among us as well.

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
Yeah, as most of the people working there were from different IITs, this helped me make some good
acquaintances which will surely be helpful to me in the future.

### After the Internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective?
My internship was in the Risk Division, dealing with model risk management. The department is very mathematical, and the experience will be amazing if you love maths.
