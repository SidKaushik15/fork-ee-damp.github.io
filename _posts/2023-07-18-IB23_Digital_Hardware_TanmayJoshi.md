**Basic Information:**

**- Name:** Tanmay Joshi

**- Curriculum:** Electrical Engineering

**- Year of Study:** 4th

**- Company/University of Internship:** Google hardware

**- Year of Internship (eg. \'23 Summers, \'22 Winters):** '23 Summers

**- Mode of Internship (Online/Offline/Hybrid):** Offline

**- Duration of Internship:** 10 weeks

**Getting into the Internship:**

**- What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?**

I wanted to get an internship in a core profile for electrical
engineering, and in digital design/ computer architecture fields to be
more precise.

**- What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?**

Second year courses such as EE309, EE204, EE224, EE214 established basic
concepts for the expected knowledge for my internship preparation, and
revising them was a good start. Besides this, I had searched for
resources to learn basic verilog syntax and some additional concepts not
included in my iteration of EE224. Revising CS101 also helped since some
coding was required.

**- Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?**

There were two interviews, one was majorly based on simple coding based
off of CS101, and the other was on more relevant topics such as
architecture, VLSI and digital logic. Most questions were answerable if
one is well-versed with the concepts discussed in class.

**- Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?**

The most persistent concern I had to face during the internship season
was to decide what I wanted. To get more clarity on that, I had to talk
to a lot of people who were doing internships in the fields I considered
a good fit for me, and had to know their preparation strategies, their
work experience, the internship role's demands and challenges, etc.
Furthermore, one also has to study and prepare for interviews amidst the
ongoing semester, so time management was also a concern which had to be
tackled by shifting priorities.

**During the Internship:**

**- What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?**

My project is mainly based on RTL design in which one has to use
verilog/system verilog to implement logic based off of a design one
ideates, as per requirements mentioned.

**- How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?**

My experience as an intern at Google has been really good in almost all
aspects. I really liked the work environment, the culture, and the work
itself is quite interesting as well. The internship duration seems to be
sufficient enough for the project I've got. Many people also have
verification based roles, however, where python and TCL are the majorly
used languages.

**- Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?**

The culture here is very warm and welcoming, and assimilation into it is
quite smooth. There are a lot of amenities and perks provided, like
food, cab services(which matter a lot if you are in Bangalore),
recreational facilities, and so on. Mistakes are not frowned upon and
mentors and employees are very helpful. The work being done is
meaningful as well and not just for the purpose of an internship.

**- Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?**

There definitely are a lot of opportunities here for networking and
making connections with both interns and full-time employees, and most
employees are happy to share their experiences in the firm and give
insights about the domain.
