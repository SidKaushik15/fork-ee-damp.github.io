### Basic Information

- **Project Title**: 1) LLC resonant DC DC Converter design & Small signal modelling 2 ) exploring resonant topologies to be used in a integrated EV charger and its analysis
- **Name**: B Madhav Rabin 
- **Project**: BTP
- **Semester(s)**: 7,8
- **Guide**: PROF Sandeep Anand(Guide), Prabhakar, Dhruv Kachiya, Jitesh kumar, Nachiketa Deshmukh(co guides)

### Abstract


I formulated a design procedure for LLC converter based on some readings.It was a entirely hand calculated procedure.I verified design by simulation in LTSPICE  . Also did small signal modeling in time domain & compared the freq to output transfer function plot with some existing small signal models & identified the best fit
### Any courses you completed relevant to the project


EE653.EE654 Is also good.I hv thr lecture recordings .You can contact me by mail if reqd.I can also share the resources I utilized for BTPA(online & offline resources)
### Describe your experience on the project


It was involving simulations later on, which might be bit frustrating,  however the conceptual part is very involved as well as interesting
### Describe your experience with the guide


Excellent in all aspects
### Any advice for anyone considering a project under the same guide? Any other professors working in similar fields?


He is very  open & free to approach. I think Prof Vivek Agarwal,  Prof Shiladri Chakraborty are also in similar fields
