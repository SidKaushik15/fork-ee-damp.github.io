### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
My primary target was quant roles. I was also interested in a robotics role that Sony was offering

#### What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?
The cornerstone of my preparation was Xinfeng Zhou’s textbook, ‘A Practical Guide to
Quantitative Finance Interviews’. I also practised Zetamac regularly and scoured the internet for
puzzles and brain teasers

#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
The interview was over Google Meet in an LT and consisted of three rounds - two technical and
one HR. The first technical round was very informal. I introduced myself, and the interviewer
broke the ice by discussing my interests (video games!). He also asked me about a couple of stuff
on my resume. Next, he proceeded to ask me a combinatorics problem. I was able to start solving
it, but I got stuck on a certain aspect. Since I was vocal about my thought process, he could
course-correct me towards the final solution. The second question was basically a game theory
question. We discussed various strategies until I realised the final solution. Hence, my entire first
interview was more of a discussion than an interview. I was assessed majorly on my ability to
convey my thought process effectively. The second technical round was less informal. The second
interviewer started firing questions the second he joined the meet - no introductions whatsoever
(it was pretty intimidating back then, haha). The first puzzle was based on probability theory. I
had to develop an inductive relationship to find the expectation of a random variable. The second
puzzle was based on game theory, and the third puzzle was based on applying Laplace’s equation
to the discrete setting. Once again, my best friend was communication. Constantly updating the
interviewer on your thoughts and ideas will ensure you don’t get stuck anywhere for too long.
Finally, the HR round was to determine if I was a good fit for the company - I was asked
questions about my interests and hobbies.

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
The main challenge I faced was the bias that quant firms had favouring CSE students. Jane Street
decided not to have any qualifying tests. Based on resumes, they shortlisted several CSE students
and only the top 5 DRs of the EE department (I happened to be DR 6, haha). I faced similar
branch-based rejections from Citadel and Tower Research Capital. While it made sense for the
company to filter candidates as much as possible, it sometimes felt unfair. Optiver and Graviton
had much fairer selection processes in this regard.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
I was shortlisted for two quant firms on day 1 (tech) - Optiver and Quadeye. I was rejected by
both of them. This really demotivated me. I had to wait a week before the non-day 1 companies
started their interviews. That one week was pretty hard. I started to question my decision to apply
for quant firms exclusively. I talked to friends and family a lot to try to make sense of everything
and to calm myself. Funny enough, I found solace in probability. So, I had a couple of bad
interviews on day 1 - that just means I’ll have some good interviews down the line. As long as
you ensure all tests and interviews are independent of each other by not pressuring yourself,
you’re bound to do well somewhere.

### During the internship:

#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
I am a quantitative researcher (I am halfway through my internship at the time of writing this).

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
My internship entails a lot of interaction with the employees. This means I get really good
exposure to everything a quantitative firm does. Daily (sometimes even hourly) updates with my
mentors are commonplace. The timings are pretty relaxed (10 am - 8 pm), and interns are given
two days of paid leave per month. They also put us up in a 5-star hotel for the entire duration of
the internship, so accommodation wasn’t something we had to worry about.

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
Everyone is super friendly and easy to approach, whether it’s something informal or
project-related. My co-interns are mostly from IITs, and a couple are from Princeton and MIT. We
have a lot of fun together, and the company hosts parties and outings almost every week. The
team you’re assigned to also takes you out for parties. Overall, everyone from the traders and the
HR to the team leads do their best to maintain a friendly, creative, and respectful workplace.

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
None beyond the employees and the interns themselves

### After the Internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective?
I highly recommend this internship to anyone interested in pursuing a career in Quant. I did not
expect this level of interaction with the employees going into the internship. It’s a highly
nurturing and encouraging environment where a couple of mistakes won’t ruin your internship.
They try to be as employee-centric as possible, and I must admit they succeed
