### About
Our lives in IIT are hostel-centric, and we interact more with our wing-mates and hostel-mates rather than department people. Suppose there are only a few hostel seniors (or maybe none) from your department. In that case, one may miss out on department-related information like interesting courses or projects, timetable issues, etc. The nitty-gritty in courses and some pre-planning/timeline-making are things only an experienced person can advise about. The EE-DAMP intends to bridge this gap to bring about this information exchange in an effective manner.

That said, the DAMP also helps students struggling in academics. We help bridge the gap between students, the department, and the faculty (mainly their faculty advisor(s)). Also, we intend to obtain feedback from students regarding the current curriculum so that our faculty learns the students' perspectives on academics. To help out the Institute Academic Council, the DAMP mentors also request professors for summer/winter projects so that students can get some research exposure.
