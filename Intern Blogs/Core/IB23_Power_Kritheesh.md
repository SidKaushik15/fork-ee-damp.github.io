**Getting into the Internship:**\
 **- What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?**

**- What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?**

**- Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?- Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?**

**- How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?**

I focused mainly on the core and software profiles. Though I was open to all fields in electrical, I preferred digital or embedded domain. To prepare for the tests, I mainly relied on the course content (slides and my notes). I learnt a few additional concepts online that were frequently asked in tests and interviews, like static timing analysis.

I had the option of choosing intern work related to power electronics or embedded systems during my JLR interview. When I opted for the latter, questions about microprocessors, digital circuits, basic analog (RLC circuits, rectifiers, and op amps), and controls were asked. Additionally, there was a standard coding question. I heard from some of my co-interns who chose power that they were asked questions related to converters and transistors in their interviews. The overall atmosphere of the interview was professional and cordial, and I was able to establish a good rapport with the interviewers. The interviewers seemed genuinely interested in my responses and asked insightful follow-up questions. For the questions which I was not able to answer, they gave hints to help me get to the answer. I had a really positive interview experience.

**During the Internship:**\
 **- What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?**

**- How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?**

**- Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?**

**- Were there any networking opportunities or professional
connections that you established during the internship?**

My profile is electric powertrain and I\'m working with the charging software team (this blog post is written during the fourth week of my internship). I\'ve got the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects and gain hands-on experience in the field. The team is knowledgeable and encouraging, and we were allowed to choose the project aligning with our interests. There is a strong culture of knowledge-sharing and mentorship, where more experienced colleagues are always willing to guide and help interns with their blockers. Everyone, from team members, mentors, managers to department heads, is very approachable and open to conversation. There is a healthy work-life balance and the perks to working for a high-end automobile manufacturer add an extra special touch too. There were arrangements for photo sessions with the JLR cars on the first day, and we were offered test drives of the cars for licensed drivers upon request.

**After the Internship:**\
 **- Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective?**

I\'d highly recommend JLR to those of you who are interested in power electronics and/or controls and who are looking to work on embedded systems in the automotive industry. Although a few core companies open for multiple domains, a profile is almost always exclusively for a single domain (like analog, digital etc). But if you\'re like me, interested in interdisciplinary work covering two or more domains, then JLR would be a great company for you to target.

**For people who have completed their intern:**\
 **- What are you currently involved in or pursuing following the completion of your internship?**

**- In what ways has the internship influenced or impacted your current activities and future endeavors?**
