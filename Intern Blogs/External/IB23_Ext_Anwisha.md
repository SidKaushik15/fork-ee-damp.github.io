 **Getting into the Internship:**\
 
 **- What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?**
 I was sure from the day I started apping that I wanted an intern in
 the core profile. I had targeted VLSI and Embedded profile primarily
 while applying.

 **- What resources did you utilize to prepare for the tests/interviews?**

 I had practiced some coding in C. For this I watched some videos on
 youtube and tried some practice problems on VS Code. For VLSI, I read
 mainly about FPGA and HLS and prepared a bit of Verilog and VHDL. But
 I would suggest if you are going for VLSI Profile, do focus on topics
 like STA, rtl-gds flow and basics of computer architecture along with
 one mentioned earlier.

 **- Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?**

 For the interview in TCS, I was asked questions on the topics I have
 mentioned in the above question. The interviewer also asked me
 regarding the projects and the previous internship mentioned in my
 resume. For the interview in Enphase, I was asked questions on C
 Language.

 Questions on topics like pointers(static and global), structure and
 class declaration and their use, functions, arrays, strings etc were
 asked.

 **- Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?**

 So, I started apping from the end of March. Finally after apping for
 almost one month and messaging various people from different
 companies, I finally got two interview calls. One was from TCS for
 VLSI Profile and the other was from Enphase Energy for Embedded C
 (This one I got during mid End Sem). I had a technical interview for
 TCS, but I was not selected for the internship as they wanted someone
 with a good understanding of FPGA and HLS. Then I gave my second
 interview i.e at Enphase Energy for Embedded C profile. This one went
 better than the first one. Next day of the interview, I was scheduled
 for the second round. This was more of an interaction session. This is
 when I knew I was selected. The main challenge is to not lose hope
 while apping as you may get a lot of rejection.

 **During the Internship:**\

 **- What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?**

 My profile for the internship was Embedded C. My topic for the
 internship was - Signal processing on the Board for secondary control
 and protection applications.

 **- How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?**

 I always wanted to work on some kind of board. So, I was ecstatic when
 I got to know that they had exactly the same work I was looking for. I
 got to learn a lot as I had to figure out a lot of things on my own
 but at the same time the managers and the mentors were readily
 available for any guidance. We also had a few "Lunch and Learn"
 sessions where we had great discussions on some upcoming topics in
 tech. My overall experience was awesome.

 **- Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?**

 The company culture is really good. All the managers are very friendly
 and helpful. I would say the same for the other few employees I had
 the opportunity to interact with and for my fellow co-interns.
