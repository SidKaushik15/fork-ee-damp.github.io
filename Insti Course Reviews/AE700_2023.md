### Basic Information

- **Course Code**: AE700
- **Course Name**: Guidance and control of unmanned autonomous vehicles
- **Course Offered In**: 2022-'23
- **Semester Season**: Autumn
- **Instructors**: Prof. Shashi Ranjan Kumar
- **Prerequisites**: Basic course on Control Theory (Not a hard prerequisite but recommended)
- **Difficulty (1 being easy and 5 being tough)**: 2

### Course Content


Rotations and transformations between frames of reference (Euler angles, quaternions and rotation matrices), Kinematic and dynamic equations of fixed wing aircraft and quadrotor
### Feedback on Lectures


The lectures were not engaging but the slides were concise and helpful to learn the course content
### Feedback on Evaluations


The course had 2 quizzes, a midsem and an endsem and also a project consisting of 2 tasks, implementation of a research paper and implementation of course content. The exams are relatively easy and only require you to understand the content of the slides
### Study Material and Resources


The course textbook "Small unmanned aircraft" by Randal Beard suffices for most of the content 
### Final Takeaway


I would recommend this course for people interested in control theory and robotics as it teaches the kinematics and dynamic equations which appear frequently while working in robotics and it will help to have a good understanding of transformations between frames of reference
