### Feedback on Lectures
Lectures were too amazing , very interactive and the professor is too engaging in the class. Lectures of ENT 603 were one of the most interesting lectures I have attended in my insti journey.

### Feedback on Evaluations
The evaluation is very chill like questions papers were too easy if you have attended the class and also 40 percent of the course weightage comes under the group project which is very interesting in itself so if someone is punctual with classes and prepare for the project well enough then AA , AB are too easy to get 

### Study Material and Resources
Just the lecture slides and prof also provide the hardcopy of all the notes before the exam


### Follow-up Courses
ENT 602 , ENT 613 , ENT 610 

### Final Takeaway
I have taken ENT as my minor but later on I have changed my minor to Management so I want to add one thing that someone can also take it as minor and then change it if their interest changes but why I am saying you should take as minor is that, this is a new field in education and after studying this course one can get a lot of interest in ENT and they can continue with this as minor and if their interest changes then also their is no loss because as prof give good grades so one can tag the course as elective later on ....
