- **Instructors**: Mrinal Kumar
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Difficulty (on a scale of 5)**: 2

### Course Content


Techniques for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Formal models of computation, time and space complexity, Theory of NP-Completeness, Approximability of NP-Hard problems. Introduction to parallel, randomized and on-line algorithms. 
The course content overlaps significantly with the CS213M and the Prof advised students who had already done CS213M to not to take the course
### Feedback on Lectures


The lectures were quite easy to follow as compared to other CS courses, everything was taught on the board and thus no slides were provided.
### Feedback on Evaluations


The evaluation scheme was :- Quiz (15), Midsem(30), Quiz (15), Endsem (40)

Quizzes were final ans based (all or zero marks), midsem-endsem were subjective with partial marks but tougher. All closed notes
