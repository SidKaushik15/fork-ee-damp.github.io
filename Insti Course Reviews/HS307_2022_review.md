### Course Content


Pre midsem consisted of getting acquainted to terms commonly used in sociology, differentiating natural and social sciences, etc. We looked into how caste exists in everyday life. There were readings based on renowned sociologists' works. 
Post midsem, we looked at how caste manifests itself in the food that we eat. Specifically, ew looked at case studies, and some more readings. Finally, we looked at some caste statistics.
### Feedback on Lectures


Initially, I felt the lectures were a little unorganized. It is almost a monologue from the prof's end. However, the prof does encourage questions, and does enthusiastically answer them. It is very helpful to take notes, it helped me follow the flow of the course. 
Attendance was taken on A4 sheets. And it helped to attend classes attentively.
### Feedback on Evaluations


Strict, but fair. There was a midsem, an endsem, and a group project. The endsem consisted of an objective part, and two 10 mark-essays. No weightage for attendance.
### Study Material and Resources


While no book was recommended, the prof gave a lot of reading material, which was both interesting and informative. It was a good supplement to the lectures.
