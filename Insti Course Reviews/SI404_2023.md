### Basic Information

- **Course Code**: SI404

- **Course Offered In**: 2023-2024
- **Semester Season**: Spring
- **Instructors**: Kaushik Saha
- **Prerequisites**: EE325
- **Difficulty (1 being easy and 5 being tough)**: 2

### Course Content
Markov process (discrete and continuous ) and introduction to queueing systems. Note: Although brownian motion is mentioned as a part of syllabus in most websites, it isn't. 

### Feedback on Lectures
The lectures are great and would totally suffice for the quizzes and exams. Making good notes of them is mandatory as prof won't be providing any slides from his side
and .... he conducts surprise quizzes.

### Feedback on Evaluations
The evaluation is fine and the exams are easy

### Study Material and Resources
Prof does not give materials from his side and hence if you can make notes of each class you wouldn't need any reference material for theory. Nevertheless, if you missed a few classes, you can cover it from the book "Markov Chains" J.R.Norris (most of the prof's content can be found here). For practice we were suggested to use "Introduction to Modelling and Analysis of Stochastic Systems by V.G.Kulkarni"

### Follow-up Courses
SI527 (Intro to derivative pricing)
SI424 (Statistical Inderence 1)

### Final Takeaway
There are surprise quizzes conducted and thus keeping upto date and being regular to classes becomes necessary.
