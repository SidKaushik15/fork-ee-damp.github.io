### GNR 401 – REMOTE SENSING AND IMAGE PROCESSING

**Year for which the review is written:**

2015-16

**Professor who took the course:**

Prof. Avik Bhattacharya and Prof. B. K. Mohan

**Motivation behind the course:**

We use Satellite images everyday through Google Earth or Google Maps. If you want to know, how these images are captured and how they are processed further for variety applications like military, forest management. This course provides basic understanding about the vast area of remote sensing.

**Course Content:**

This course was divided into two modules. 1. Remote Sensing 2. Image Processing. These two modules were taught by different professors. The remote sensing part covered details about sensors, satellites used, medium of interaction, atmospheric effects etc. Image processing part taught different image processing techniques to process raw images acquired by sensors and draw signiﬁcant interpretation from them. It involved image enhancement operations, neighbourhood operations, image segmentation and classiﬁcation techniques. This part is very similar to what is taught in any basic image processing course.

**Course Prerequisite:**

There is no pre-requisite for this course.

**Feedback on lectures, assignments, tutorials and exams:**

Attendance policy was very lenient. Therefore, very few students attended the lectures. The exams were very straight forward. Content from the slides was sufﬁcient. If somebody has done image processing course either form EE or CSE, then this course will be very easy and a good candidate for institute elective.
