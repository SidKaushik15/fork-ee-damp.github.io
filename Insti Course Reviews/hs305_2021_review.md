### HS 305 – Reading Literature (2021)

**Course offered in:**

Autumn 2021

**Instructors:**

Prof. Paulomi Chakraborty, Prof. Ratheesh Radhakrishnan, Prof. Sudha Shastri

**Prerequisites:**

None that I know of, but being fluent in English definitely helps.

**Difficulty:**

Easy(2/5)

**Course Content:** 

1.  Prof Paulomi:   
    Arthur Conan Doyle – _The Sign of Four, Adventure of the speckled band_  
    Suniti Namajoshi – _The Princess_  
    Nadine Gordimer – _Once upon a time_

Susan Sontag – excerpts from _AIDS and Its Metaphors_(Chapters 1, 2, 5 and 8) 

Mahmoud Darwish – _A River Dies of Thirst_: Journals  
Evan Boland – _In a Time of Violence(_1994)

2.  Prof Ratheesh:   
    Mary Oliver – _Breakage, Angels, Wild Geese_  
    Muhammad Basheer – _walls_  
    Kuzhali Manickavel – _Items that have gone missing from the Lucy Tumerlin Institute for broken shape shifters containment room_


Charlotte Perkins Gilman – _Yellow Wallpaper_ 

Catherine Malibu – _To quarantine from quarantine_

3.  Prof Shastri:   
    Poems by: John Keats, Lewis Carroll, Robert Browning, Ted Huges  
    excerpts from _The Tempest_

While this might seem like a lot, since there was no midsem/endsem, for someone who just wants to complete the course, reading the content relevant to the questions asked in the assignments should suffice.

**Feedback on Lectures (Online):**

Profs expected the students to be interactive; to do some self-reading of the content in advance and add their own interpretations during class. The attendance dwindled to a handful of students towards the end.

**Feedback on Evaluations:**

Evaluations were based on 8 assignments each having 2/3 questions on the assigned literature. The word limit for each question was ~ 300 words. We were given about a week to solve each assignment. Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors were penalised. **No Midsem! No Endsem!**

**Study Material:**

PDFs of the texts mentioned above, which were provided by the Profs

**Follow up courses:**

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**Final Takeaways:**

The assignment-based evaluation meant that the course required some attention during the semester but kept you free in the Midsem and Endsem weeks.
