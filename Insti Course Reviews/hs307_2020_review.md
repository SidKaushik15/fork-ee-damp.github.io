**Feedback on lectures**: The attendance was not mandatory but 5% marks were kept for attendance >=85%. The professor gave slides for the lecture but these had only brief overview of every topic and hence going to lectures was very important. The examples give by the professor were quite interesting and one can easily relate to the subject using them. The professor addressed the doubts with enthusiasm and readily accepted doubts.

**Feedback on tutorials and exams**: There were no tutorials for the course. The instructor gave sample questions in the class. Both the examinations had multiple choice questions as well as some theory questions. The questions asked were entirely based on lectures. One essay writing task was given as a part of course which had 20% weight. The garding for the same was done very leniently.

**Difficulty** (on a scale of 1 being very easy to 5 being very hard): 3
