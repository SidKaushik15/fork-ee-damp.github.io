### Basic Information

- **Course Code**: EE325
- **Course Name**: Probability and Random Processes
- **Course Offered In**: 2023-2024
- **Semester Season**: Autumn
- **Instructors**: Prof. Sharayu Moharir
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Difficulty (1 being easy and 5 being tough)**: 3

### Course Content
Set theory basics (Countability, relations, de morgan's etc), Basic probability (Sample spaces, probability measures, independence and conditional independence), Random variables, distributions, and related inequalities, and stochastic processes.

### Feedback on Lectures
Worth attending, might feel repetitive in the first half, but being thorough with those sections of syllabus pays off. 

### Feedback on Evaluations
Grading was split between midsems, endsems, and best 3 out of 4 quizzes. The difficulty of the course increases significantly as time progresses and newer, non-jee related topics are brought in (the first few tests are easier to score higher in). That being said, evaluations are not too strict.

### Study Material and Resources
Tutorial sheets are thorough, 

### Follow-up Courses
Markov Chains and Queueing Systems (EE621)

### Final Takeaway
Test difficulties rise with time, course is paced reasonably. Most of the course is covered very well within the tutorials themselves.
