### EE 223 – DATA ANALYSIS & INTERPRETATION

**Instructor**: 
Prof. Prassana Chaporkar

**Session**: 
2019-2020

**Prerequisites**: 
N/A

**Course content and structure**:

Data Representation  
Elements of Probability  
Random Variable and Expectation  
Parameter Estimation  
Hypothesis Testing

Basic Regression was supposed to be a part of the syllabus but was not covered due to time constraints.

**Feedback on lectures**:

There are no slides for this course so taking notes is highly recommended. The professor is extremely passionate about teaching and although it can be a bit hard to understand things at times, the onus is on you to ask and get it clarified in class. Anything hand-written was allowed as notes for our exams, which again stresses on making notes. DO NOT miss lectures as tempting as that might seem, the lecture content is dense and each lecture is linked to the next. Taking lectures lightly implies shooting yourself in the foot.  
Regular Tutorials were uploaded which helped clear your concepts and helped build the foundation for the Quizzes. Try to solve the tutorials on your own as much as you can. The professor also sometimes discusses crucial concepts used in the Tutorial Sessions.

**Feedback on tutorials and exams**:  
The professor follows a different pattern. There are a total of 6(7 if the schedule permits) Quizzes and best 5 are considered. Each quiz is of a total of 20 Marks. The quizzes are generally on the tougher side and were all open book. The grading is absolute in nature.

**Difficulty** 
(on a scale of 1 being very easy to 5 being very hard): 3

**Textbooks & References**:

Notes will be your most important Asset.  
Other books that were recommended are:  
1. An Introduction to Probability and Statistics – Vijay Rohatgi  
2. Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists – Sheldon M. Ross

I personally used Rohatgi as a reference but it can be a bit tough to understand requires time investment as well as dedication.

**Grading Statistics**: 

AP – 4  
AA – 11  
AB – 22  
BB – 24  
BC – 26  
CC – 18  
CD – 10

**Additional Comments & what you learnt from the course**:
