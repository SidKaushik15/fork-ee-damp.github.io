**Feedback on Lectures**

The course ran in an online mode with recorded lectures. The videos provided by Prof Shabbir Merchant were from previously recorded CDEEP lectures. These lectures were very good with hand-drawn and handwritten explanations in the video by the professor. The lectures videos by Prof Kasbekar were a bit dry and difficult to understand in comparison and were mostly a repetition of the written content of slides shown in the video.

**Feedback on Evaluations**

Best ⅔ quizzes for 20%
Midsem for 30%
Endsem for 50%
All of them were subjective and required some thinking and application. Solving the provided practice problem sets (including questions from the reference books) helped a lot in the exams.

**Study Material and References**

Communcation Systems, 5th edition- Simon Haykin
Digital Communcation Systems- Simon Haykin

**Follow-up Courses**

EE706, EE740

**Final Takeaways**

Try to solve all the practice questions provided after watching/attending the lecture
