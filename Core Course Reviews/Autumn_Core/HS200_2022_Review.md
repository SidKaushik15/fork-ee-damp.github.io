**Course Content**
The course was covered in 3 modules: Sociology (Prof D Parthasarathy), Philosophy (Prof Siby K George), and Economics (Prof Neha Gupta). 

Sociology: This module focuses on the socio-political, cultural and governance aspects of how the environmental issues are recognised, addressed and acted on. Many videos/case studies were shown during the lecture. Note them down and go through these videos before the exam as several questions were directly asked from them.

Philosophy: This module, as the name suggests, deals with the philosophical aspect of environmental issues. It starts with basic knowledge of philosophy and builds to how certain historical and present-day philosophies have led to either environmental degradation or its betterment. Though it was a little to wrap my head around initially, it gets fascinating if you give the historical flow of the module a good thought.

Economics: economic aspect of environmental issues… It covers how markets can get affected if environmental changes are/aren't considered during economic growth. 

**Feedback on Lectures**
The mode of lectures was online and they were recorded. I didn't find it very interactive as the main focus of the professors was to just complete as much content as they can in 6 lectures (for each module). No slides were provided for Sociology, some detailed notes were given for Philosophy (must-read before the exam) and slides for Economics. As the questions for Socio and Econ were asked on things discussed during the class, lectures are important.

**Feedback on Evaluations**
Only one evaluation (midsem) was conducted for us. It had questions from all the modules combined. The questions were in the MCQ format and were easily solvable if one was attentive during the lectures.

**Study Material and References**
Nothing beyond the lectures, slides, notes and videos shared by the prof.

**Follow-up Courses**
None (Maybe ES200)

**Final Takeaways**
None
