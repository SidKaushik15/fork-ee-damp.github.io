# EE 224 – DIGITAL SYSTEMS

**Year :** 2014-15, Autumn Semester

**Instructor**: Prof. M. Baghini

****Motivation:****

The course aims at making you familiar with digital systems and by the end of course you will be able to design any system of your own using simple logic gates. This course will also familiarize you to CMOS technology, how these logic gates are realized in practice using it and speed constraints of it.

**Course Contents:**

-   Introduction to MOSFETS
-   Logic Gates
-   Combinational Circuits (Karnaugh Maps)
-   Sequential Circuits ( D Latch, SR Latch, Flip Flops)
-   Finite State Machines
-   Verilog HDL (To be followed up in Digital Lab by EE students)
-   Logic Gates using TTLs and MOSFETS
-   Ring Oscillators
-   Design of Logic Buffer
-   Basics of CMOS Transistor Fabrication and Layout
-   Time Delay Analysis of NAND Gate (CMOS)
-   High Speed Digital Systems (Introduction)

****Feedback on Lectures****

Lectures are most important part of the course. The instructor prefers to explain concepts by taking an example and using the taught concept to solve the problem. Since there is no particular book being followed throughout the course, it is essential that you are regular to the lectures and make notes. Professor keeps providing material on topics covered in the class and one should always go through the material for a good understanding of the topic.

****Feedback on Assignments, Quizzes and Exams****

The professor gives two assignments throughout the course and are quite easy to do but are quite lengthy. I would suggest not waiting for the deadline to start the assignment and start working on it a few days in advance. Quizzes are mostly based on what is taught in the class and these assignments are quite easy. However, the end semester is a bit tougher than the quizzes and one should have conceptual clarity to solve the questions.
