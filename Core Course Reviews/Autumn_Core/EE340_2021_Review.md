**Feedback on Lectures**

The course will typically start after a couple of weeks in the semester for the theory course to catch up. Lab sessions took place once a week and involved 3-4 problems in general all of which had to be solved using GNU radio. The documentation for GNUradio is somewhat incomplete and unorganised, hence it is difficult to work with. However, in most cases, the TAs and the professor help the students with the software. The professor also made sure to run the course in parallel to its theory counterpart (EE341 Communication Systems) and clarified any doubts regarding the lab work before each session. There was a short pre-lab quiz conducted each week. The questions were rather straightforward and sometimes directly from the assigned reading material provided prior to the lab session. Go through the lab work before the session, some of them are rather time-taking and it might be a good idea to get started with the labwork before the session to finish within the designated time.

**Feedback on Evaluations**

60% inlab assessment + pre-lab quizzes
40% Endsem submission + viva
The viva part of the evaluation depended a lot on your TA and thus ill-matched across groups. Grading was pretty chill, standard lab course grading, exact details can be found on ASC.

**Study Material and References**

Pre-lab reading material should be sufficient in most cases. For the theory, one can refer to material from EE341. 

**Follow-up Courses**

Any advanced communication systems course
