**Review by**

Satush Parikh, 2025(BTech.)

**Course Offered In**

Autumn 2022

**Instructors**

Professor V.M.Gadre 

**Prerequisites**

None. Core course for Elec B.Tech and DD

**Difficulty**

Moderate

**Course Content**

The course is divided into four Modules.

- Module 1: Systems and their properties: linearity, shift-invariance, causality, and stability. Linear Shift Invariant (LSI) Systems and their detailed analysis. Convolution and its properties
- Module 2: Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms. Fourier Domain Analysis of Signals and Systems.
- Module 3: Sampling and Reconstruction of bandlimited signals - the Nyquist/Shannon/Whittaker Sampling Theorem: its consequences, implications, and applications. Introducing discrete time signal processing.
- Module 4: Generalized Transform Domains – The Laplace Domain and the Z-Domain
 
**Feedback on Lectures**

The instructor is enthusiastic and passionate about teaching and takes his words very seriously. Blackboard is used for teaching and hence taking down notes is necessary. Sufficient examples are discussed. The instructor generally takes a round in the class after giving a problem to see how the students approach the questions. Challenge problems are frequently offered, and solving them earns credit. Although attendance is not taken in every class Instructor is strict about attendance; when the attendance dropped, a class test was conducted whose marks were considered in the final evaluation.
<!-- The lectures were moderately paced. The topics were explained very well. Most concepts were mathematical in nature with application in signals and systems. The mathematical construct of concepts were explaind first, followed by a example related to signals and systems. The practice problems provided were sometimes difficult but extremely beneficial in understanding as well as practicing the concepts and for quizzes. The prof made digital notes during the lecture which were provided to students -->

**Feedback on Evaluations**

The grading is divided into saturated and unsaturated scores. Students are given better of grades awarded through saturated and unsaturated scores. The unsaturated score consists of various activities like solving challenge problem,problem-posing assignments, class test,
Application Exhibition (where students summarised their understanding of an article related to the course from any IEEE magazine of their choice) etc. Saturated scores consisted of Endsem(40%), Midsem(25%) and class-participation component(35%).
<!-- The prof conducted 7-8 short quizzes throughout the semester. The quiz duration was 40-50 min. These were often long and mathematical given the time duration. The questions were directly based  on the practice problems provided, hence going through them was very important. -->

**Study Material and References**

Lecture Notes are sufficient. Problem sets were provided during the beginning of the course and were not difficult but some questions were time consuming.
Book:
1. A.V. Oppenheim, A.S. Willsky with S. Hamid Nawab, "Signals and Systems", Pearson Education Signal Processing Series, Second Edition, Sixth Indian Reprint, 2004. 

**Follow-up Courses**

This is a first course in signal processing and many courses build up on it.
<!-- Specialization Electives for DD-Communication and Signal Processing can be considered as follow-up courses. -->
- EE 338 (Digital signal processing)
- EE 678 (Wavelets)

Specialization Electives related to Signal Processing for DD-Communication and Signal Processing can be considered as follow-up courses

**Final Takeaways**

A very good introduction to basic concepts of signals and systems.
