**Review by**
Tanmay Joshi, 2024(BTech)

**Course Offered In**
Spring 2022

**Instructors**
Prof. Virendra Singh

**Prerequisites**
EE224 in some aspects.

**Difficulty**
The topics are at a moderate level of difficulty but fairly understandable if you are attentive in all lectures.

**Course Content**
In order, the course contained instruction set architectures, microprocessors like 8085, 8051, instructions for 8051, assembly language programming, timers, interrupts, delays, peripheral interfacing, instruction hardware flowcharts, microprocessor architectures like RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer) and
CISC(Complex Instruction Set Computer), multi-cycle and single-cycle processors, processor pipelining and cache memory.

 
**Feedback on Lectures**
Lectures were taught in great detail and the instructor taught concepts so that they were
intuitive. Sometimes topics were repeated a few times and it was ensured that everyone who paid attention could understand them. The instructor gave many examples time to time and explained concepts thoroughly. The first half majorly involved assembly programming, and in the second half the instructor explained processor architectures using some example ISAs and processors.

**Feedback on Evaluations**
Evaluations were a black box and the exact weightages were not known at all, but the
final grading can be classified to be fairly lenient. There was one assignment, one midsem, one endsem, one project and one bonus project involved. The exams were not time limited and you could take up as much time as you want.


**Study Material and References**
Some reference books might be needed for revision, like Mazidi and Ayala.


**Follow-up Courses**
CS683, EE677, EE739 can be taken up after this course.


**Final Takeaways**
EE309 is an amazing course which introduces you to many aspects of processors and their applications in real life, and it is beautiful to get to know how every component or block takes its place in the working of the entire microprocessor, ultimately explaining you the basics behind the workings of microprocessors.
