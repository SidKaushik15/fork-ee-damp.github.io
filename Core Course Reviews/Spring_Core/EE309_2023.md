### Feedback on Lectures
Lectures taken are incredibly detailed and very easy to understand. Each lecture almost always begins late and with a recap of the last lecture. The lectures might seem a little slow, but it is essential to attend them, particularly from an examination point of view. 

### Feedback on Evaluations
Evaluations are very weird with atrociously low scores and "infinite-time" exams being commonplace. All exams are open-book. Weekly quizzes are conducted, however the most weightage is given to the course project, which is fairly detailed. However, grading is very lenient with a large number of A grades.

### Study Material and Resources
Only lectures - they are sufficient and necessary 

### Follow-up Courses
EE739, CS638

### Final Takeaway
It's an excellent introductory course to Computer Architecture, although it might be a little slow at times. The project is particularly interesting and yields new insights.
