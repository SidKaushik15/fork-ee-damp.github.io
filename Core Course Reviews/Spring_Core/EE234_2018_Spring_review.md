### EE 234 : MACHINES LAB

**Academic Year :** 

2017 â€“ 2018

**Semester :** 

Spring

**Instructor:** 

Prof Kishore Chatterjee

**Motivation:**

This course is designed to introduce students to Machines and to help them in the course EE 222 : Power Electronics. The experiments are to be done once in two weeks and one lab session is of 1.5 hours. So, in terms of hours, this course requires less time. The course has a list of experiments which helps you get your concepts of EE 222 cleared out. The lab demo sessions help before each lab session and those are very informative, It is advisable to pay attention to all the lab demos and introductions. These can be very helpful during end semester examinations. The experiments are listed below. The experiments are more or less expected to be the same.

**List of experiments**

1. Lab 5 Torque-Speed Characteristics of Three-Phase Squirrel Cage Induction Motor.

2. Lab 4 Characteristics of Separately Excited DC motor

3. Lab 3 V-I Characteristics of DC Generators

4. Lab 2 OC and SC tests on single phase transformer.

5. Lab 1 Power measurement in balanced 3 phase circuits and power factor improvement

**Expectations:**

To begin with, shoes are compulsory. The instructor and the lab assistants expect that you are well aware of the theory and have thoroughly read the reference material given before each lab. Be very thorough with the Wattmeter connections as it is required in each lab and many Lab Assistants ask you this. Also, be prepared for viva. The professor may take viva any day.

**Examinations:**

The lab assistants may or may not take viva during experiments but be prepared. Lab reports are checked thoroughly and they carry marks obviously. The End Semester exam carries a huge weight and should be given due importance.

**Grading:** 

Easy

**Difficulty:**
