**Course offered in:**




Spring 2018


**Instructors:**


Prof. Kishore Chatterjee 




**Course Content:**


1. Electrical Drives and motor speed control :Structure of Drives, Typical types of loads,DC and Induction Motor, Motor-load Interaction,
2. Speed control(Armature resistance control, Voltage control, V/f control etc).
3. Electrical Devices: Diode, Thyristor, GTO(Gate turn-off Device), BJT, Power MOSFET.
4. AC to DC converters
5. PWM technique to control inverters.
6. Inverters(single phase, 3 phase).
7. DC to DC converters ( Buck Converter,Boost Converter,Buck-Boost converter,Fly-back Converter)




**Prerequisites:**
EE 111. The professor assumed working knowledge of Induction Motors which wasn’t covered well during our EE111 course, so be sure you go through that well.
**Feedback on Lectures:**
Lectures are the single most important thing in this course. Slides given are not detailed and do not help if you’ve not attended the lectures. The Professor doesn’t follow one standard book making it very difficult to self-study. Making extensive notes is almost a must for this course and while the lectures might get boring sometimes, resist the temptation to get distracted because it is pretty tedious to study that on your own later. The Professor follows 80% attendance policy and manual attendance is taken in all the lectures. 
**Feedback on Tutorials, Assignments and Exams:**


No tutorials were conducted as such. The assignments were lengthy and took a fair bit of time, but helped clear your concepts pretty well. The Mid semester was fairly simple to attempt if you had solved the assignment on your own. Apart from the Midsem, a quiz was also conducted which was an hour long and not very difficult. Calculations errors are common.
Hack: While writing the answers show all intermediate steps and explicitly write down all the values found in the in-between steps. Apparently there were marks for that too.




**Difficulty:**
(On a scale of 1 being very easy to 5 being very hard): 2
**Grading Statistics:**


AA -> 42
AB -> 49
BB -> 43
BC -> 10
CC -> 7
CD -> 2
DD -> 1
FF -> 2




**Textbooks & References**
Reference textbooks cited by the Professor were:
1. Principles of Electrical Machines and Power Electronics – P.C. Sen
2. Fundamentals of Electrical Drives – G.K. Dubey
3.Power Electronics: Converters, Applications, and Design – Ned Mohan, Undeland, Robbins.
But the professor did not use any single reference textbook for teaching. The books were only useful for some additional practice questions (GK Dubey) and reading about a concept that you did not understand in the lecture.
