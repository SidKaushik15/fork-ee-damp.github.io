**Course offered in:**



Spring 2017



**Instructors:**



Prof. Anupama Kowli



**Course Content:**

Basic three phase system concepts

Power system components: Generators, Loads, Transformers, Transmission Lines etc

Modeling, performance and constraints of these components

Formulation/solution of steady state equations for interconnected systems

Balanced and Unbalanced systems

Positive Sequence Network, Per Unit System, Ybus formation

Introduction to generator swing equations and stability issues

Interconnected System Operation and Control

Operational Objectives, Frequency Control, Voltage Control and Power Flow Control

Analysis of Faulted Power Systems and Protection

Unbalanced System Analysis using Sequence Components,

Equipment Protection Schemes, Preventive Control and Emergency Control System Protection Schemes

**Prerequisites:**

There are no prerequisites as such. A brush up of the topics covered in EE 111 and EE 222 may be useful for some parts of the course.


**Feedback on Lectures:**

The current course content is pretty extensive for a power systems course and teaching picks up pace as the semester proceeds. It might not be very easy to follow the professor in the class as she isn’t used to handle such large classes but the professor is helpful and cooperative otherwise. The lectures slides cover all points but not in a detailed manner hence it is advised to pay attention. The attendance isn’t enforced directly in terms of awarding a DX but might affect your chances to take a makeup exam (which could be used to make up any exam before endsem). It is advisable to attend lectures as one can lose track of the content very easily and it only gets tougher to follow it up later on.

There were 2 quizzes (10% and 15%), a midsem(30%) and an endsem and a makeup exam. The exams were of moderate difficulty. You can expect either midsem or endsem to be on the tougher side especially if you haven’t followed the content thoroughly and closely. The quizzes tend to be on the easier side and the professor might choose to vary the difficulty depending on the class performance. The make up exam, however, is on the difficult side. As far as tutorials are concerned, the set of questions in the tutorial aren’t difficult as such but it may take time to develop a knack for such questions. Hence it is advised to solve by themselves rather than looking at the solutions directly even though the former may be a time consuming process. It helps in the exams. The professor also uploads the solutions 4-5 days after uploading the tutorial which is generally close to a quiz or exam and hence it is advised to solve the tutorial by yourself first.The tutorial questions form a reasonably comprehensive practice problem set.


**Difficulty:**

In terms of content of covered, the course is on the easier side even though the content may be lengthy. However, the general consensus on the difficulty of exams was that they were moderately difficult as mentioned previously. It is strongly advised to follow the content regularly and attend the lectures. The core concepts are overall pretty easy, however, the mathematical constructs may get a bit involved at times. The course, in bits and parts, is interesting.


**Grading Statistics:**


Relatively eased out.


**Study Material and References:**

1. Power System Analysis by John Grainger and William Stevenson
2. Power System – Analysis and Design    by Duncan Glover, Mulukutla Sarma and Thomas Overbye

The professor follows these books extensively and closely so these are a must have. The content is overlapping to large extent in both the books, however, the professor prefers different books for different topics. The examples are good in the latter are suggested for practice.
