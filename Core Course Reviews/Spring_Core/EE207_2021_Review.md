**Review by**

Jay Sonawane, 2024(BTech+MTech Dual Degree)

**Course Offered In**

Spring 2021

**Instructors**

Prof. Dipankar Saha

**Prerequisites**

None

**Difficulty**

3/5 

**Course Content**

The course starts with introduction to semiconductors: p, n type and intrinsic. Then a brief overview of different carrier transport phenomena in uniformly doped semiconductors is taught. 
Followed by this, pn junction diode is introduced and the underlying physics of Schockley's equation is covered. After pn junction diode, MOS capacitor fundamentals and MOSFET is taught. In comparison to a MOSFET, the underlying physics of BJT is taught.

**Feedback on Lectures**

The instructor is interested in students' learning only. The lectures are slow paced and the professor encourages asking questions a lot. The professor stresses on intuition and expects students to understand the physics. You should take notes if the professor is Dipankar Saha.

**Feedback on Evaluations**

1. Quiz-1 (15) 
2. Assignment (15)
3. Midsem (20)
4. Endsem (50)

**Study Material and References**

Ben G Streetman, Banerjee Solid State Electronic Devices

**Follow-up Courses**

EE620, EE724, EE723

**Final Takeaways**

The professor is interested in students' learning only and it might feel that the evaluation is not stressed upon. The course will help you to get interested devices.
The exams require a good grasp of concepts and the types of questions asked by this professor is quite different. Less stress on mathematics and more stress on intuition is given. The evaluation might become unfair in these cases since sometimes intuitions can agree to disagree but only one of them is accepted.
