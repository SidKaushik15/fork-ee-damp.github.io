**Review by**

Sanika Padegaonkar, 2025(DD)

**Course Offered In:**

Spring Semester, 2022 (4th Sem)

**Instructors:**

Debraj Chakraborty (DD)

**Prerequisites:**

None

**Difficulty:**

Medium

**Course Content:**

* Control System/Feedback Examples
* Modelling 
* Transfer function, 
* State space, interconnection with transfer function
* Block diagrams, signal flow graphs, similarity transforms
* Transient Response Analysis
* Stability
* Steady-state errors
* Root Locus, design
* Bode and Nyquist plots, design 
* State space design

**Feedback on Lectures:**
For the online part of the course, 2-2.5 hours of pre-recorded video lectures were provided every week. Live interactions were held during the lecture slots where the instructor asked questions to randomly picked students, thus ensuring that everyone kept up with the course content. The course picked up pace once offline lectures began. One needs to be very focused in the lectures as a lot of content is covered. Missing lectures is not an option because it is difficult to follow the forthcoming topics without knowing the previous ones. Overall, the lectures were a little fast-paced but very interesting if attended regularly. 

**Feedback on Evaluations:**
Homework Assignments (4-6): 10%
Quizzes (3): 30%
Mid sem: 20%
End-Sem: 40%

The exams and quizzes could be quite lengthy sometimes, and the key to tackling these was to attempt as many questions as possible. The questions were primarily based on the content covered in class, so you should be able to do fairly well in the quizzes if you’re regular in class. The midsem and endsem exams were cumulative. There was one homework assignment every 3-4 weeks, giving us plenty of time to complete them. The homework assignments covered almost all the topics, thus improving the grasp on them. 

**Study Material and References:**
Text Book
1.Norman S. Nise, Control Systems Engineering, Wiley India, Student Edition (Fifth), 2009 ----Every student is required to have access to a copy (or pdf).

Reference Books
1. Richard Dorf and Robert Bishop, Modern Control Systems, Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008 
2. Gene F. Franklin, J. Davis Powell, Abbas F. Emami-Naeini, Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems, Pearson, 2018.

**Follow-up Courses:**
Multivariable Control and Computation Lab(EE 615)


**Final Takeaways:**
Overall, the course isn’t difficult per se but demands regularity in attending lectures and practice. The ongoing topic generally depends on the previous one so keeping up with the course content is a must. A little bit of regular effort can make this course very interesting.
