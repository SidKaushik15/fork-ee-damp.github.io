**Semester**  – Spring 2016

**Professor(s)**  – Prof. M. B. Patil, Prof. K.L. Narasimhan

**Motivation**  – To gain practical experience about the concepts taught EE204 Analog Circuits course.

**Course content**  – The lab has weekly experiments which cover op-amps, transistors. At the end there are two projects, each 2 week long, which cover the concepts taught throughout the semester.

**Feedback on labs**  – Mostly all the experiments required a simulation exercise prior to the lab, a lab report and post-lab report. The lab experiments in general were easy and followed the lab sheets uploaded. Debugging circuits is a useful skill to be picked up during the experiments. Each experiment was graded based on the pre-lab and post-lab reports and the lab performance.

**Feedback on exams**  – Mid-semester examination included a simulation exercise and an experiment which tested basic knowledge covered in the experiments. End-semester examination did not include any simulations, only experiment. The mid-sem and end-sem did not have direct experiments performed during the semester. Rather they tested the basic understanding of the concepts covered in the experiments.

**Grading**  – The grading was pretty lenient.

**Difficulty**  – Easy but time consuming due to pre-lab and post-lab reports.
