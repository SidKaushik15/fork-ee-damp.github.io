**Year:** 2016-17 Spring Semester

**Instructor:** Prof. Madhav Desai

**Motivation:** This course goes in hand with EE224. Thus it increases the understanding of digital systems and helps to design a digital system.

**Course Content:**

The first experiment included a circuit which was to be assembled on a breadboard.  The rest of experiments did not include any circuits. Those experiments included designing of a machine which behaved in a particular manner. This designing included basic coding in VHDL. Then the code was simulated in Quartus and finally, it was uploaded on hardware and which was verified using a testbench and Tiva-C.

**Feedback on Labs, Exams:**

It was expected that the algorithm of the problem is known to everyone before lab session starts. If the algorithm is known before lab starts then it was possible to finish lab in time otherwise the lab is going to extend or else you have to complete the lab session later on.

The problem given in exams were similar to that of lab problems. In exams the time provided was sufficient.

**Grading:**

The grading was on the lenient side. Following are the grading statistic:
