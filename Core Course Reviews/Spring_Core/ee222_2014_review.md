**Academic Year:** 2013 – 2014

**Semester:** Spring

**Course Instructor:** Prof. Kishore Chatterjee (KC)

**Motivation:** 

A Sequel of EE111, this course will give an insight into working of electrical machines in daily life;, driving trains,  building elevators, creating a 20v source from 10v source, converting AC to DC voltage of your will, knowing your comp’s SMPS (atleast theoretically). EE222 deals extensively with making, working and ratings of power electronic devices like inverters, buck-converters, boost converters etc and gives you a feel of an on-field engineer. You’ll learn electrical drives and speed control of DC and Induction motor  used in various applications like electric trains, elevators etc .

**Prerequisite:** EE111 (Infact some quizzes were conducted solely on EE111).

**Course-content:**

1. Electrical Drives and motor speed control :Structure of Drives, Typical types of loads,DC and Induction Motor, Motor-load Interaction, Speed control(Armature resistance control, Voltage control, V/f control etc).
2. Electrical Devices: Diode, Thyristor, GTO(Gate turn-off Device), BJT, Power Mosfet.
3. AC to DC converters(Rectifier)
4. PWM technique.
5. Inverters(single phase, 3 phase).
6. DC to DC converters ( Buck Converter,Boost Converter,Buck-Boost converter,Fly-back Converter)

**Lectures:**

Not attending the classes implies screwing yourself. There isn’t one standard text book for this course. Hence knowing what your professor wants you to know is important to get a good grade.Professor follows 80% attendance policy. Manual attendance is taken in all the lectures.Lectures are very useful. Slides are used but aren’t detailed enough for easy reading. Lot of board-work involved.

**Assignments:**

Initially few graded- assignments were given to revise EE111 and to practice speed control. Few assignments were given for later topics of which only one was graded. Assignments are usually long, require lot of calculator-work and hence can’t be completed overnight without a nightout. It’s best to finish them gradually over a week.

**Exams:**

4 to 5 quizzes are conducted, contributing about 15% of marks. Each quiz is a hour long and not very difficult. Calculation errors are common. Midsem is for about 25 % and similar to the quizzes. The Endsem carries a hefty 50 % weightage and usually the deciding factor of grades. Endsem requires through revision and practice to be finished on time.

**Difficulty:** Moderate (may be a bit content-heavy)

**Grading:** Please Check ASC and decide for yourself.  Grading is absolute with marks difference of about 15 between subsequent grades.

**References:** No standard book is followed.
